## Why did you do this?

BF is a really good language for learning about compilers. With only
eight operations, it's way more feasible to build elaborate features
like compile-time evaluation. Also, it's fun.

## What license is bfc under?

bfc is licensed under GPLv2 or later. Sample programs are largely
written by other authors and are under other licenses.

## What is the logo?

It's a gingerbread man with **B**u**F**falo plaid. I felt it captured the
silliness of the whole project.

## Why not write "Brainf***"?

The unfortunate name of brainfuck is [discussed on the esolangs
wiki](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck). Some writers even
use the term "the unmentionable programming language".

To avoid confusion (and help search engines), this website uses the
term "brainfuck" on the home page. Other pages use "BF".

## Are there other BF optimisers?

There are! Some noteworthy examples I've seen are:

* https://code.google.com/p/esotope-bfc/wiki/Optimization
* http://www.nayuki.io/page/optimizing-brainfuck-compiler
* http://mearie.org/projects/esotope/bfc/
* http://calmerthanyouare.org/2015/01/07/optimizing-brainfuck.html
* [http://xn--2-umb.com/10/brainfuck-using-llvm](http://xn--2-umb.com/10/brainfuck-using-llvm)
* https://github.com/stedolan/bf.sed (simple optimisations, but
compiles directly to asm)
* https://github.com/matslina/bfoptimization
* [Platonic Ideal Brainfuck Interpeter](http://catseye.tc/node/pibfi)
  [(src)](https://github.com/catseye/pibfi) (even has a profiler!)
* https://github.com/rmmh/beefit (uses LuaJIT)
